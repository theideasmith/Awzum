How to Create Your Own Programming Language
===========================================

Creating a programming language from scratch is hard. It takes several attempts before
finally coming up with a fully working language. This system will teach you all the 
tricks you need to know to make your language come to life. This is a great skill to 
put on your resume and it's also fun to learn.

The system will walk you through each step of language-building. Each section of the 
book will introduce a new concept and then apply its principles to a language that 
we’ll build together. All technical chapters end with a Do It Yourself section that 
suggest some language-extending exercises. You’ll find solutions to those at the end of
this book.

Our language will be dynamic and very similar to Ruby and Python. All of the code will
be in Ruby, but I’ve put lots of attention to keep the code as simple as possible so
that you can understand what’s happening even if you don’t know Ruby. The focus of this
book is not on how to build a production-ready language. Instead, it should serve as an
introduction in building your first toy language.
